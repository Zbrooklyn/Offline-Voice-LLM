# Offline Voice Assistant with TTS - STT and LLMs
Use TTS - STT with Mistral-7b or Other LLMs for an Offline Voice Assistant

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to the research and development of an offline voice assistant using Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems integrated with Large Language Models (LLMs) like Mistral-7b.

## Motivation

The goal is to create a reliable offline voice assistant, especially considering the vital role of TTS in such systems. While there are solutions like Whisper AI and Bark AI available, there's a lack of information about their compatibility with LLMs.

## Requests for Collaboration

- If anyone has experience or knowledge about the integration of Whisper AI, Bark AI, or similar systems with LLMs, your insights would be invaluable.
  
- For those who have worked with Google Colab notebooks demonstrating the use of TTS with LLMs, sharing such resources would be of great help.

- Additionally, information on any TTS AI systems compatible with LLMs would be much appreciated.

## Commitment to Open Source

As this project progresses, all findings and solutions will be shared with the community. Contributions, insights, and feedback from the community are highly encouraged.

## Getting Started

These are the resources we've found so far that can help with integrating TTS with LLMs and setting up an offline voice assistant:
